In the first lecture I learned the following:

1. Create a Repo - Created a Github repository. 

2. Created a directory using the mkdir command to house my coding files from the text editor.

3. Used an SSH key from the Github repository to clone a local file I created using terminal commands.

4. Created a text file using touch test.txt.

5. Modified this text file and then used Git Status, Git add, Git Commit and Git Push to push the files to the internet. 

6. Used a pull request from Git Hub to upload the files.

6. Then repeated this process deleting lines and inserting new lines.

6. Used a pull request to upload this, splitting the branch. Review and accepted the changes to merge the split branch to the main branch.
